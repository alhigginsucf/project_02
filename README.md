# Giph Search Engine
Alexander Higgins
Project 02- utilized mutliple technologies learned over the past 9 weeks to build a functioning
search engine using a GIPHY API key. jQuery, using the API key, retrieves data from GIPHY to inturn display on the webpage depending on what is placed into the input. The technologies used in this project are as follows: .html, SASS converted into .css, .js (jQuery). HTML was used to build the webpage, SASS was used to
style the page and "live SASS watch" was used to convert into CSS. Several different fonts were imported from google as well. jQuery was in conjunction with API key to
retreive API from GIPHY to ultimately be display 30 .gifs on the website depending on what user submits into the input. There was difficulty in making the page fully responsive and I could improve on making the 
website fully compatible with smaller devices.
